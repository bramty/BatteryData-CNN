# Implementation of Convolutional Neural Network for Estimating Battery's State of Health
## Overview
Utilizing the NASA battery dataset from [1], the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) to estimate a battery cell's state of health is presented in this repository. This work follows the same method shown in [2]. For more details, please refer to **CNN - NASA Battery Dataset.pptx** in the repository.
